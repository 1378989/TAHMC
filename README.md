# TAHMC
A new pipeline, named transcriptome analysis of host-microbiome crosstalk (TAHMC), was proposed for restoring both host gene expression and microbial quantification from bulk RNA-seq concurrently

#The procedures of TAHMC

1)Bulk RNA-seq data processing and mappingï¼š

2)Microbial data decontamination and normalization
